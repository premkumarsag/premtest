		which is probably what most people need. The use-case for this
		service is operational monitoring by external systems. So it
		is possible to check, if a new deployment or human error
		introduced a situation where application will most likely
		fail because of an interpolation not being resolved.
		A new ACL and local group (both named WxConfigCheckInterpolators)
		were introduced to allow for custom authentication.
