# WxConfig: Export of encrypted values

# For automatic import during startup of WxConfig this file needs to copied 
# (name must not be changed) to the path specified by the location alias
# "BULK_IMPORT_ENCRYPTED_VALUES". By default it points to "${wx.config.encValues.bulkImport.location.default}",
# which resolves to
#
#   $SAG_HOME/IntegrationServer/instances/default/${wx.config.encValues.bulkImport.location.default}
#
# To change the file location go to "Settings / File Location Aliases" in
# the web UI of WxConfig and click the edit icon next to the current value.
#
# At startup of the WxConfig package this file will be picked up
# (search pattern = ${const:com.softwareag.wx.is.config.security.BulkExportImport.BULK_EXPORT_IMPORT_FILEMASK}), 
# processed, and renamed afterwards to prevent duplicate processing. 
# The new name contains the date/time when it was processed and "SUCCESS" 
# or "FAILURE" to indicate the result of the operation. 
# Further details can be determined from the WxConfig log
# file ($SAG_HOME/IntegrationServer/instances/default/logs/WxConfig.log).
#
# It also possible to have the bulk-import triggered when a package's
# configuration gets loaded by WxConfig. Two parameters exist to control
# this:
#
#   - ${const:com.softwareag.wx.is.config.security.BulkExportImport.KEY_EXECUTE_ON_PACKAGE_LOAD}={true|false}
#
#       If set to "true" (default: false), when a package's values get loaded
#		into WxConfig, there will also be a bulk-import of encrypted values
#       from files (see next paragraph for selection of files).
#
#   - ${const:com.softwareag.wx.is.config.security.BulkExportImport.KEY_LIMIT_FILE_SEARCH_ON_PACKAGE_LOAD}=EncVals_MYPKG*.txt
#
#       This wildcard expression controls what files are being processed 
#		during package loading bulk-import of encrypted values.
#		This avoids picking up files that belong to other packages and
#		should be processed at a different time. If not specified, the
#		default (${const:com.softwareag.wx.is.config.security.BulkExportImport.BULK_EXPORT_IMPORT_FILEMASK}) will be used.
#		During startup of WxConfig itself (as opposed to loading the config 
#		values for a package), this value has no effect; in that situation the 
#		aforementioed default kicks in.
#
# For a successful import, it is required to replace the placeholders with
# the actual passwords as described below.
